# 🌱 Tidy Bloom  - Grow Together
*A calm, gamified cleaning app that turns chores into small wins.*



## 📖 Overview  
**Tidy Bloom** helps people with executive function challenges, busy day-to-day lives, or children who may struggle with task initiation and completion.  

The app guides you to:  
- Pick a room or self-care routine  
- Start a short focus timer  
- Earn points and streaks as you make progress  

Your efforts grow a plant, and eventually a garden — one seed at a time. The design is **gentle, non-judgmental, and supportive**, while still giving structure and momentum.



## 💡 Why  
Most cleaning apps assume **unlimited motivation and time**. Tidy Bloom is built for **real life**:  

- Reduces **choice overload**  
- Lowers the **activation energy** to start  
- Rewards **consistency over perfection**  

It reframes mundane chores into something fun and motivating through a metaphor:  

> *“Life is a plant you water day by day.”*
